# ScratchTrack
A command line program for browsing and tagging local files. (Ideally suited for keeping track of directories with many small miscellaneous files)

Scratch Track is written in Python 2.7 and uses the Peewee ORM. It was written to help me keep track of the many informal/throwaway
scripts and text files I have been generating while learning python. It was also a helpful way to introduce myself to databases.
